Spreader

Simple distributed RPC queue.

Spread is a distributed system to run command-line scripts in parallel. It aims
at being extremely fast and extremely simple. At the moment it assumes that it
is either operated in single machine mode (where multiple worker processes all
run on the same machine) or in multiple-machine, shared filesystem mode, where
workers run on different machines but have access to the same paths for input,
output files as well as executables. In other words, Spread does not transfer
files between machines. Support for multiple machines not sharing filesystems will
come in a future release.

See the example directory for working sample code.

Requirements:
    Python 2.7 or later
    RabbitMQ
    pika Python module
